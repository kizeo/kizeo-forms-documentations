## The SharePoint Connector

The SharePoint Connector is an application that runs in the Chrome and Firefox browsers. It allows you to synchronize data between Kizeo Forms and SharePoint on 4 levels:
- [Kizeo Forms data to a SharePoint list](sp-update-list.md),
- [Kizeo Forms data to the SharePoint library](sp-upload-files.md),
- [SharePoint lists to External lists](sp-update-kf-list.md),
- [Kizeo Forms data to the SharePoint library (Periodic exports)](sp-sheduled.md).

**The installation of the SharePoint connector requires advanced IT skills. It is reserved for IT specialists.**

Its configuration and use are accessible to all people who know how to use SharePoint.

You can download the setup [HERE](https://github.com/kizeo/sharepoint-connector/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
